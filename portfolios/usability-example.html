      <h3>Heuristic Evaluation: A Case Study From Austin Community College</h3>
      <p class="introduction">
        One concept that consistently comes up in the study of both the fields
        of quality assurance and visual communication is heuristic evaluation.
        When I enrolled at Austin Community College to study design principles,
        I encountered this familiar idea repatterned as
        <strong
          >Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface
          Design</strong
        >.
        <br />
        Heuristics are guiding principles that support quick, efficient
        decision-making. They offer a structured framework for assessing the
        usability and functionality of complex systems. With over a decade of
        experience in manual software testing, I’ve developed an intuitive sense
        for applying these principles in practice. As part of my introductory
        UX/UI coursework, I evaluated the
        <a href="https://www.austincc.edu/admissions"
          >Austin Community College admissions website</a
        >. <br />The review was conducted using Chrome on macOS on December 1,
        2024.

                  "I am..." dropdown. Relocate the language selection to the
                  main header. Remove the header "ACC Admissions: Apply to ACC"
                  as its redundant.
