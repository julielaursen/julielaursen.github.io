      <h2>Content for Social Media Posts @DevOpsDays Austin</h2>
      <div class="introduction">
        As a marketing organizer, I created a series of social media posts for
        the
        <a href="https://devopsdays.org/events/2025-austin/welcome/"
          >DevOpsDays Austin</a
        >
        conference. The goal was to promote the event and engage with the
        community. The posts were designed to be visually appealing and
        informative, highlighting key speakers, sessions, and networking
        opportunities. This is my first year as a marketing organizer for
        DevOpsDays Austin, and I hope to continue learning and iterating.

      <h2>Post Examples</h2>
      <div class="introduction">
        I created a series of posts to promote the event and engage with the
        community. I used different user personas to craft posts targeting students, individual contributors, managers, recruiters, and sponsors. At DevOpsDays, we also never miss an opportunity to pass on a good
        dad joke or some nostalgic humor.</div>

      <h2>Example Social Media Calendar</h2>
      <div class="introduction">
        I created a social media calendar to plan and organize the content
        strategy for DevOpsDays Austin 2025. The calendar includes details such
        as post dates, times, content types, descriptions, and calls to action.
        I often filled out several weeks worth of posts in advance. This helped ensure a consistent and engaging presence on social media
        leading up to the event. This is an example of a social media calendar, but the real calendar was created with Buffer, which integrates with Canva and allows scheduling posts in advance.
