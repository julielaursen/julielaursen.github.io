    <h2>My Accessibility Testing Process</h2>
    <main>
      <h3>My fake website with accessibility errors</h3>
      <div class="introduction"> This webpage was intentionally designed with accessibility issues as part of a Responsive Design course project at Austin Community College. While I did not build the original site, I repurposed it specifically to demonstrate how to identify and prioritize accessibility violations. Many links are non-functional -- this is intentional and part of the design. Since I was not involved in the content creation of the original design, elements were unknown in advance.

      <h3>Documenting my auditing process</h3>
       <div class="introduction">
        I test using a mix of tools to check whether a website is accessible to all users, including those who rely on screen readers or keyboard navigation. These tools include <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview">Lighthouse</a>, <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/voiceover/welcome/mac">VoiceOver</a>, 
        <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>, and <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/about-nvda/">NVDA</a> to ensure compliance
        with WCAG 2.1 AA standards. I also included automated accessibility checks using Cypress.io, a programming framework that simulates how users interact with a website in a browser. Once I identify problems, I prioritize them based on their severity and how much they affect the user experience, especially for people with disabilities.

      <h3>My example report to stakeholders </h3>
      <div class="introduction">
        This is an example of the type of report I would share with stakeholders. Once I have documented the accessibility failures in a spreadsheet, I use pivot tables and charts to summarize and visualize the data, helping non-technical audiences quickly understand the scope and impact of the issues. My final report with clear and actionable recommendations is designed to support collaboration, raise awareness, and drive positive change.
